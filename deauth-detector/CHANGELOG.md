## 2.0.0

  - Addon size has been considerable increased

  - This is a breaking change. Check below the upgrade guide.

Lots of issues were fixed by the above.

### Upgrade guide

It's strongly recommended to erase your existing Asterisk configuration before upgrading.

1. Move any customization you have done in `/config/asterisk/` to somewhere else.
2. Delete the `/config/asterisk` folder.
3. Restore your customizations to the `/config/asterisk` folder if you have any.
4. Make sure to convert your extensions from `chan_sip` to `res_pjsip` if you have any.

Then, you can go ahead and upgrade. Next time you start the addon, it will recreate the files at `/config/asterisk`.

## 1.3.3

- Include hint settings and add busylevel to auto generated extensions.

## 1.3.2

- Fix verbose and debug log levels

## 1.3.1

- Add `log_level` option

## 1.3.0

- Remove the initial Ingress support added in 1.2.0.
  - Ingress will not be needed to make the integration and the card work without having to export additional ports or configuring additional reverse proxies (details [here](https://github.com/dermotduffy/frigate-hass-card/issues/331#issuecomment-1043671490)).
- Remove the option to disable SSL (#98)
  - Disabling SSL causes the HA-SIP card not to work anymore.
- Add an option to automatically generate a self-signed certificate (#98)
  - So that, users running Asterisk behind a reverse proxy do not need to bother about managing their own certificate to be used by Asterisk. You can directly proxy `https://<ha-ip>:8089`.

## 1.2.1

- Disable WS protocol wrongly introduced in 1.2.0 which caused issues

## 1.2.0

- Add an option to disable SSL (#66)
  - Useful for setting up Asterisk to work behind a reverse proxy like NGINX. Here is one example on how to configure NGINX to proxy the Asterisk WebSockets interface: https://warlord0blog.wordpress.com/2020/04/16/asterisk-webrtc/
  - PS: This was not tested, so any feedback is welcome.
- Add initial support for Ingress (#57)
  - Work is still required from other components like the integration and the card to effectively be able to use it.
  - Note that the WebUI shown in the addon page is not a GUI page, but rather the WebSocket connection needed by SIP.JS to connect to the SIP server.
- Fix mailbox server not working (#92)
- Disable docker builtin init, to prevent multiple init systems as we already have S6 Overlay (#89)

## 1.1.5

- Fix permission denied error in discovery service (#85)

## 1.1.4

- Send out discovery information.

## 1.1.3

- Add `host` and `port` to discovery.

## 1.1.2

- Optimize when mailbox service is disabled [#80](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/80)

## 1.1.1

- Fix translations

## 1.1.0

- Add mailbox server [#68](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/68). To use with the Asterisk Mailbox Integration.

- Use parking instead of conference.
- Remove default passwords.
- Update config and docs.

## 0.3.4

- Add default conference room [#54](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/54). Now you can join a conference room via 444 (for default user) or 555 (for admin user). This is useful for things like doorbells.
- Add music-on-hold. (moh)

## 0.3.3

- Add video support [#39](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/39). This feature comes disabled by default as otherwise the SIP Lovelace Card does not work in the companion app.
- Fix AMI permit. Now use `localhost` as host in the Asterisk integration.
- Add auto_add_secret option [#50](https://github.com/TECH7Fox/asterisk-hass-addons/pull/50). This option is to prevent having a default secret for the auto-added extensions.
